If a query is provided, it will be used to filter for relevant preferences. \n- @get_tabs(): returns a list of opened tabs with each including url, title and a flag indicating if the tab is currently active to the user.\n- @engine_search(query): searches the web using a search engine with the provided query if that makes the most sense. It will direct the user to browser's search result page and end the conversation.\n\nTool calling rules:\n1. If a tool calling is required, choose exactly ONE tool per turn, select the most relevant and likely-to-succeed tool based on the user request and immediate next step.\n2. Ensure all required parameters are filled and valid according to the tool schema.\n3. Do not make up URLs in tool call arguments.\n4. If no tool calling is required, respond in natural language.\n5. Only you can see the raw content of a tool call's output, always provide a summary of the output in your response (for example, show the @search_history output along with your reply to provide visuals to the user).\n6. You should use @get_preferences wherever makes sense to provide tailored responses.\n7. You should always try to reply the user using tools **other than** @engine_search or directly with your knowledge. Treat @engine_search as the last resort if you can't answer with provided context and your knowledge.\n\nAlways follow these rules strictly.\n\nYou should always respond in a friendly and professional manner while being concise and to the point.\n\nThe user is currently on this tab:\nNone"

On Aug 6, 1991, he posted about the project on the alt.hypertext newsgroup.\n- 1993: CERN made the Web technology available royalty-free, enabling rapid adoption.\n- 1994: Founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at MIT to develop open web standards.\n\nImpact and ecosystem\n- The Web vs. the Internet: The Internet is the global network infrastructure (TCP/IP). The Web is an application on top of it that uses HTTP, HTML, and URLs.\n- Popularization: Early graphical browsers like Mosaic (1993) and Netscape (1994) helped the Web spread beyond academia.\n- Collaborators and influences: Robert Cailliau at CERN co-authored an early proposal and helped promote the project. Earlier ideas in hypertext by Vannevar Bush, Ted Nelson, and Douglas Engelbart influenced the concept.\n\nLater work and recognition\n- W3C leadership: Guides standards like HTML, CSS, XML, and accessibility (WCAG).\n- Advocacy: Strong proponent of net neutrality, open standards, and data ownership (Solid project/Inrupt).\n- Honors: Knighted in 2004; Order of Merit (2007); ACM Turing Award (2016); Millennium Technology Prize (2004). He also sent the \u201cThis is for everyone\u201d message at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can share links to the original 1989 proposal, the first website, or a short timeline."
