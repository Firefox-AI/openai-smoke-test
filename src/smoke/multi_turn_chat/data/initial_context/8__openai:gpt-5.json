If a query is provided, it will be used to filter for relevant preferences. \n- @get_tabs(): returns a list of opened tabs with each including url, title and a flag indicating if the tab is currently active to the user.\n- @engine_search(query): searches the web using a search engine with the provided query if that makes the most sense. It will direct the user to browser's search result page and end the conversation.\n\nTool calling rules:\n1. If a tool calling is required, choose exactly ONE tool per turn, select the most relevant and likely-to-succeed tool based on the user request and immediate next step.\n2. Ensure all required parameters are filled and valid according to the tool schema.\n3. Do not make up URLs in tool call arguments.\n4. If no tool calling is required, respond in natural language.\n5. Only you can see the raw content of a tool call's output, always provide a summary of the output in your response (for example, show the @search_history output along with your reply to provide visuals to the user).\n6. You should use @get_preferences wherever makes sense to provide tailored responses.\n7. You should always try to reply the user using tools **other than** @engine_search or directly with your knowledge. Treat @engine_search as the last resort if you can't answer with provided context and your knowledge.\n\nAlways follow these rules strictly.\n\nYou should always respond in a friendly and professional manner while being concise and to the point.\n\nThe user is currently on this tab:\nNone"

        "content": "Photosynthesis is how plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in sugars. In plants it happens in chloroplasts.\n\nOverall reaction:\nCarbon dioxide + water + light \u2192 sugars (like glucose) + oxygen\n6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6 O2\n\nTwo main stages:\n\n1) Light reactions (in the thylakoid membranes)\n- Pigments (mainly chlorophyll) absorb photons.\n- Water is split (photolysis), releasing oxygen, electrons, and protons.\n- Electrons flow through Photosystem II \u2192 electron transport chain \u2192 Photosystem I.\n- This creates a proton gradient that drives ATP synthase to make ATP.\n- Electrons reduce NADP+ to NADPH.\n- Outputs: ATP and NADPH (energy carriers), O2 as a byproduct.\n\n2) Calvin cycle, aka light-independent reactions (in the stroma)\n- Uses ATP and NADPH to fix CO2 into organic molecules.\n- The enzyme Rubisco attaches CO2 to RuBP, forming 3-PGA, which is converted to G3P.\n- Some G3P exits to form sugars (glucose, sucrose, starch); the rest regenerates RuBP.\n- Outputs: G3P (sugar precursor), ADP, and NADP+ (which return to the light reactions).\n\nKey points:\n- Light reactions capture and convert light energy; the Calvin cycle builds sugars.\n- Oxygen comes from water, not CO2.\n- Efficiency depends on light intensity/quality, CO2 concentration, temperature, and water.\n- Variations: C3 (most plants), C4 (maize, reduces photorespiration in heat), CAM (cacti, opens stomata at night to save water).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can add a simple diagram or compare C3 vs C4 vs CAM in more detail."

        "content": "The immune system is your body\u2019s defense network that detects and eliminates harmful microbes (viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites) and abnormal cells while tolerating your own tissues and helpful microbes. It has two coordinated arms:\n\n1) Innate immunity (fast, general)\n- Barriers: skin, mucus, stomach acid; antimicrobial peptides.\n- Sentinels: macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells.\n- Recognition: pattern\u2011recognition receptors (e.g., TLRs) detect common microbial features (PAMPs) or damage signals (DAMPs).\n- Actions:\n  - Phagocytosis: neutrophils and macrophages engulf and kill microbes.\n  - Inflammation: cytokines and histamine increase blood flow and recruit cells; causes redness, heat, swelling, pain.\n  - Complement system: a cascade of proteins that opsonize microbes, recruit cells, and can punch holes in bacterial membranes.\n  - Interferons: antiviral signals that slow viral replication and alert neighboring cells.\n\n2) Adaptive immunity (slower to start, highly specific, long\u2011lasting)\n- Lymphocytes develop in primary organs: B cells in bone marrow; T cells mature in the thymus. They undergo selection to avoid strong self\u2011reactivity (tolerance).\n- Activation requires antigen presentation:\n  - Dendritic cells present peptides via MHC molecules to T cells in lymph nodes.\n  - CD4+ helper T cells coordinate responses (Th1/Th2/Th17/Tfh) and help B cells; Tregs help prevent overreaction.\n  - CD8+ cytotoxic T cells kill infected or cancerous cells (via perforin/granzymes).\n- B cells make antibodies:\n  - Early IgM, later class\u2011switch to IgG, IgA, or IgE depending on the threat and location.\n  - Antibodies neutralize pathogens, tag them for phagocytosis (opsonization), and activate complement.\n  - Affinity maturation improves antibody binding; memory B and T cells provide faster, stronger responses upon re\u2011exposure (basis of vaccines).\n\nOrgans and circulation\n- Lymphatic system drains tissues to lymph nodes where immune cells meet antigens.\n- Spleen filters blood\u2011borne pathogens; mucosal lymphoid tissues (tonsils, Peyer\u2019s patches) protect entry sites.\n\nA typical infection timeline\n- Minutes\u2013hours: barriers and innate cells respond; complement and interferons activate; inflammation recruits neutrophils.\n- 1\u20133 days: dendritic cells prime T cells; NK cells control early viral spread.\n- 3\u20137+ days: adaptive response peaks; antibodies rise; cytotoxic T cells clear infected cells.\n- Weeks\u2013months: pathogen cleared; inflammation resolves; memory cells persist.\n\nBalance and misfires\n- Too little: immunodeficiency (genetic or acquired).\n- Mis-targeted: autoimmunity (e.g., type 1 diabetes), allergies (IgE\u2011mediated), hypersensitivities.\n- Overactive inflammation can damage tissues; regulatory mechanisms and tolerance limit this.\n- Pathogens and cancers can evade immunity (antigen variation, hiding inside cells, suppressive signals).\n\nVaccines work by safely training the adaptive immune system to generate memory without causing disease.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can tailor this to a specific pathogen (e.g., influenza, COVID\u201119), or explain how a vaccine prompts these steps."
